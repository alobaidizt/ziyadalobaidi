**Thrilled**! That's how I feel while typing my first blog.

After working on rebranding my websit over the past few weekends, it feels surreal to finally be able to publish online in it's new cover.

I look forward to publishing occasionally in the future at a 1 - 2 blogs per week. I have many projects that I have worked on and looking forward to work on others in the future, and I very much intend on sharing this newfound knowldge as well as my results on this blog.
